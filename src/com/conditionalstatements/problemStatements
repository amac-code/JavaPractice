Problem 7: Time of Day Greeting
Write a program that takes the current time (in hours) as input and prints a greeting message based on the time of day (e.g., "Good morning," "Good afternoon," or "Good evening").

Problem 8: Character Classification
Create a program that takes a character as input and classifies it as a vowel, consonant, digit, or special character.

Problem 9: User Login
Design a simple user login system. Ask the user for a username and password, and then check if they match predefined values. Print "Login successful" or "Login failed" accordingly.

Problem 10: Temperature Converter
Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Allow the user to choose the conversion direction and input the temperature value.
Problem 11: Palindrome Checker
Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Problem 12: ATM Withdrawal
Create a simple ATM program that asks the user for their account balance and the amount they want to withdraw. Check if the account balance is sufficient, and if so, deduct the withdrawal amount. Print the new balance or an error message if the balance is insufficient.

Problem 13: Guess the Number
Design a number-guessing game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. Provide hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until the user guesses the correct number.

Problem 14: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Write a program for a rock-paper-scissors game. The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer also makes a random choice. Determine the winner based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

Problem 15: Simple Calculator
Create a basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations based on user input. Handle invalid input gracefully.

Problem 16: Number to Word Converter
Write a program that takes a numeric input (e.g., 123) and converts it to words (e.g., "one hundred twenty-three"). Handle numbers up to a certain limit, and print an error message for out-of-range values.

Problem 17: Fibonacci Sequence
Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. Print the sequence and the sum of the terms.

Problem 18: Discount Calculator
Design a program that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart. Apply discounts based on the total amount spent. For example, give a 10% discount for a total of $100 or more.

Problem 20: Number Classification
Create a program that takes an integer input and classifies it as positive, negative, or zero. Additionally, check if the number is even or odd.
