1. **Check for Duplicate Elements**
    
    Write a program that checks if there are any duplicate elements in an array of integers. Print "Duplicates found" if duplicates exist; otherwise, print "No duplicates.”
    
2. **Find Missing Number**
    
    Write a program that finds the missing number in an array of integers. The array contains all integers from 1 to n except for one missing number.
    
3. **Check for Palindrome Array**
    
    Write a program that checks if an array of integers is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward. For example, [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] is a palindrome array.
    
4. **Check for Sorted Array**
    
    Create a program that checks if an array of integers is sorted in ascending order. Print "Sorted" if the array is sorted; otherwise, print "Not sorted.”
    
5. **Array Difference**
    
    Design a program that finds and prints the elements that are present in the first array but not in the second array. Assume both arrays contain unique elements.
    
6. **Array Search**
    
    Create a program that searches for a specific element in an array of integers. If the element is found, print its index; otherwise, print "Element not found.”
